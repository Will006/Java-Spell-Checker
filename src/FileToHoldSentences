My mom drove me to school fifteen minutes late on Tuesday.
The girl wore her hair in two braids, tied with two blue bows.
The mouse was so hungry he ran across the kitchen floor without even looking for humans.
The tape got stuck on my lips so I couldn't talk anymore.
The door slammed down on my hand and I screamed like a little baby.
My shoes are blue with yellow stripes and green stars on the front.
